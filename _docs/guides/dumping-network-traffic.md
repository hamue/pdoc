# Dumping Network Traffic

First, you'll need to disable certificate pinning, see [here](un-nning).  

Once that is done, there is two main utilities you can use: 

- Rastapasta's node app [https://github.com/rastapasta/pokemon-go-mitm](https://github.com/rastapasta/pokemon-go-mitm).
- Taras Bulba's .Net app [https://github.com/TBulbaDB/PoGoMITM](https://github.com/TBulbaDB/PoGoMITM)

If you use Windows, the second one is much simpler to install. If not, the first one is probably what you need.
